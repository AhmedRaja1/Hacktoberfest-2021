# FlameControlAndroid
Flame Control an android app which can be used to connect to an esp32 using BlueTooth Low Energy (BLE) and control the color an RGB LED. This is an effort to save some time for newbies who are looking to get into BLE Development.

# How to Run the App
Clone the source code and open it in Android Studio. Connect an Android BLE Compatible device (Make sure to turn on USB Debugging on the phone) and run the application.

# Esp32 Part
Download or clone [this](https://github.com/hammad1201/ESP32_BLE_UART_RGB_LED) repository and open the **ESP32_BLE_UART_RGB_LED.ino** file. Upload it to esp32 to start advertising.

## Esp32 Connections
Connect an Common Cathode RGB LED to esp32 as:

Red Pin ===> 13

Cathode Pin ===> GND

Green Pin ===> 12

Blue Pin ===> 14


This is the pinout of a common Cathode RGB LED.
