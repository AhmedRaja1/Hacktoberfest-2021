                    <p>Artificial intelligence is possessed by modern day computers, robots and latest technologies.

Whereas the natural intelligence is knack of humans and several animals. Artificial Intelligence means the easiest approach to achieve a goal successfully. Today, AI (Artificial Intelligence)

has a tremendous impact on our lives and the world around us. It has changed the way of thinking, communicating, banking, defense and entertainment. Now days we are definitely circled by AI.
</p>

                    <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

                    <p>Today we have artificial virtual assistants that work effectively and smoothly, we rely on chat bots and stuff like that, we are definitely become dependent on them for our daily life activities.</p>

                    <p>
Although we have made the use of Artificial Intelligence to develop robots and modern machines having an efficiency a hundred times than a human being, though they have manipulated our lives

by serving us and doing our petty tasks such as online transactions, pizza deliveries and answering customer service calls.</p>

                    <p>But there is always a room for more development and more innovation in this field such as the mechatronics and robotics engineers are finding new ways to manipulate human feelings in robots.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

                    <p>These marvelous leaps in technological advances present both opportunities and challenges. There are lots of opportunities for young innovators to do great types of inventions in this field.</p>

                    <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                    <blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

                    <p>The biggest challenge among innovators is the design of latest and modified microprocessors for AI which have the qualities of natural intelligence. In the near past, the best examples of Artificial intelligence manipulated devices are

the drones, are being adapted for all kinds of creative tasks such as weather navigation instead of spying and bombing activities. One way AI can be more effective than the human brain is its capacity of storing large amount of data at once and scan

it within seconds whereas humans lack the ability to store enormous amount of data at once.</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">AI At Its BEST</h2>
<p>In short, Artificial Intelligence has huge impact on us but on the same time it has a vacant space for modification which eventually provides opportunities of innovation.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
