# DSA-Project_AutoCorrect-Word

This is my Semester Project. 

## Description
Coded in C++, this project is an implementation of the widely used feature Auto-Correct / Auto-Complete Word. The project uses file words.txt to read out the english words and upon wrong word input from the user gives the nearest correct word. 

## Sample Working
### (Auto-Correct)
Word entered: teh

Output:  Did you mean ‘the’?

### (Auto-Complete)
Word entered: hel

Output: Did you mean ‘hell’ or ‘hello’?
